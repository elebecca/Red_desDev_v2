Landing Page Dev

1. Choose one design to code
2. Code without using any frameworks (like bootstrap etc.)
3. Use CSS Media Queries for Responsiveness


## Try to achieve:
- Code Compatibility across browsers and devices
- Retain Readability and Image Quality across devices
- Code for: Mobile (portrait), Tablet (portrait), Tablet (landscape) and Laptop/Desktop screen resolution


## Shortcuts:
- don’t worry about design/picture elements - those don’t have to match. you can choose your own images. please remember this assignment is all about correct and bug free responsive front-end code.
- feel free to use fonts.google.com
- feel free to use any SVGs or FontAwesome
- feel free to use any icons as PNGs
- feel free to improve or expand on selected design.


## Bonus Points for:
- adding expanding/dropdown burger menu (JS)
- adding any HTML5/CSS animations to elements
- compatibility with mobile landscape
- cookie pop notification (JS close, or display for 5 seconds and close (JS))


## When completed:
- Send over or host your landing page
- Share how long it took you to complete the code

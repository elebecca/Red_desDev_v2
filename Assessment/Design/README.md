Test completed in 5 hours

## Summary:
I used the same elements for all the different sizes. 
The call of actions is the most visible element of the page. 
I tried to use the space and the elements to guide the user to what I want to go.
The use of the wood sign is actually an arrow that pushes the user to look for the instructions
 on how to register and how to have the 30 spins free.
